fb-places-pro
=============

Chrome extension to enhance the productivity of the fb places editor https://www.facebook.com/editor

This extension puts the normal fb editor map inside a box to the right of the main editor.
It then adds several useful controls to the editor.

The current production version of this extension is installable from
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fb-places-pro/imnppmbmlacllpppkbcnjfnadjikmpgi?hl=en-US

I've had requests for a Firefox version. If anyone would like to work on that please fork
this repo!
